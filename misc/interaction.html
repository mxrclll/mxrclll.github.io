<h1>Risks</h1>
<h2>Reduced human contact</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p class="intro">One of the problems of human aging is that it often leads 
to a great reduction or loss of social life and interpersonal communication. 
The use of nursing robots is worrying. The use of robots in elderly care to 
perform tasks such as lifting things, carrying objects, and even cleaning the room,
 interacting with friends and family, or having dinner together, will lead to the elderly 
 experiencing reduced human social contact. For example, if robots are used for tasks such as
 cleaning floors, this will eliminate valuable opportunities for social interaction between cleaners 
 and the elderly. Using robots to take care of the elderly may be convenient, but it will eliminate the 
 need for detailed and caring interactions with people.
 </br></br>
  Evidence suggests that reducing human contact and the isolation of elderly people may raise the likelihood
 of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It is critical that the elderly have intellectual stimulation
 and social connection in order to lessen their chances of developing these mental diseases. Human 
 contact has also been demonstrated to lessen stress levels, therefore it is crucial for the 
 elderly to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The risk of using a robotic companion, such as the interactive 
 robot - pepper, may increase the user's chances of social isolation. Friends and family may believe that
 the robot fulfils the elderly person's needs, which may decrease human contact, making the elderly 
 person more prone to stress and having an increased risk of developing a mental illness.
