<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<h2>Inclusivity</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p class="intro">Different people prefer different things based on their 
personality; a study showed that those who are introverted tended to prefer 
a robot with its original mechanical appearance whereas those who are extroverted 
had more of a liking towards robots with a more human-like appearance. It would be 
of interest to include multiple designs for inclusivity and to take into account a 
personâ€™s mental state. This would create a variety of robot options regarding both 
physical and social traits. Perhaps people, especially the elderly, would be more 
inclined to the idea of robotic companions if they were given the opportunity to
 pick and choose one that aligns with the qualities that they would enjoy in a 
 companion themselves.
