<h1 class="title">Social Robots</h1>
<h2>PARO</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p>An example of a social robot is a baby harp seal named PARO. 
PARO is specially designed to assist older people with dementia. 
They emulate the social benefits one would gain from a pet, 
but they can also be used by those who suffer from allergies, 
as there is no risk of pet dander making them a better option 
for people living in care facilities. PARO simulates genuine 
interactions and companionship and has shown to help reduce behavioural 
and negative emotions for elderly suffering from dementia. 
A U.S study has shown that the patients who interact with PARO, 
improve their social engagement in activities and social interactions, 
which consequently enhances their quality of life and wellbeing.
