<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<h2>Acceptance</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p class="intro">Future developments for robotic companions for the elderly would most 
likely include the implementation of social and psychological aspects for the robot itself, 
as there is some evidence of elderly people unwilling to accept help electronically. The more 
human-like the robot is (in terms of conversation) the more enjoyable it will be for the user. However, 
this would require a lot of testing and design, as the robot would need to be socially intelligent, possibly 
recognize social cues and respond appropriately. There have been studies that show what the robot looks like
 correlates with its acceptance among humans as well as overall likability. While there are a multitude of 
 robots currently in the works, most revolve around either cognitive rehabilitation, which are those that are
 more accustomed to helping with physical assistance, or social aspects, which are those that will 
 have communication capacities. A study showed that, if given the choice, elderly people were more 
 inclined to choose robots which were discrete and small, an example being PARO. In the same study, 
 elderly people had been deterred from mechanical-looking robots, as they seemed like “children's toys”. 
 Perhaps in the future, taking in this feedback from the elderly and integrating it into the design of robotic
 companions would allow for a higher acceptance rate. </p>
