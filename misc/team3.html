<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

Abstract In a modern society where the degree of aging is increasing and the pressure of elderly care is increasing, the promotion of robots for the elderly is an important means to solve the problem of elderly care. Although there are indeed some ethical risks in the use of robots to help the elderly, the machines Providing for the elderly have certain benefits for society, families and the elderly. Although the "emotions" of robots are different from human emotions, helping the elderly robots can meet the emotional needs of the elderly to a certain extent, and we should not simply reject them. In the process of our research on this topic as a team, I mainly found the risks of technical feasibility, so this paper on ethics will explore the robot care of elder risks.</br></br>
The reduction in contact. One of the problems of human aging is that it often leads to a great reduction or loss of social life and interpersonal communication. The use of nursing robots is worrying. The use of robots in elderly care to perform tasks such as lifting things, carrying objects, and even cleaning the room, interacting with friends and family, or having dinner together, will lead to the elderly experiencing reduced human social contact. For example, if robots are used for tasks such as cleaning floors, this will eliminate valuable opportunities for social interaction between cleaners and the elderly. Using robots to take care of the elderly may be convenient, but it will eliminate the need for detailed and caring interactions with people.</br></br>
Using robots to take care of the elderly, there is a major ethical issue that needs attention, because it involves the objectification of the elderly and the way how robots can effectively perform elderly care tasks. Who controls the robot? Is the actual purpose of this approach to help the elderly, or to reduce costs and reduce the workload of caregivers? If a robot designed to only replace a nurse or caregiver can perform some of the same tasks as feeding, lifting, etc., it may make their charge feel like an object. Compared with relying on human care, this kind of robot will make the elderly feel even less in control of their lives. If they are all mechanical-like actions, such as using robots to lift and move the elderly insensitively, the well-being of these elderly people may be reduced.</br></br>
A loss of privacy. The elderly may be worried that the operator will look around their apartment while the remote-controlled robot is changing clothes or taking a bath. If the elderly's mental state deteriorates further and becomes confused, the problem will become more complicated. People with Alzheimerâ€™s may forget that robots are monitoring them, and may think that you are acting or talking in the privacy of your own home. In addition, who should have access to this information and for how long should it be kept? With the mass storage hard drives available today, it is possible to record the entire rest of the lives of the elderly, and the privacy rights of the elderly present a big problem.</br></br>
In conclusion, the world population of people over 60 years old will reach nearly 1.7 billion in 2040. Taking care of elder robots can basically meet the daily basic needs of the elderly. Regarding the ethical risks that robots may bring about helping the elderly, we need to conduct ethical governance from multiple perspectives so that robots can better serve humans.
