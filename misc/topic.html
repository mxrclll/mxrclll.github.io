<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>
<div class="whitebox">

Our topic of choosing is robotic companions for the elderly,
 which we believe are quite relevant given the current circumstances. 
 They prove to be an interesting idea to look into and we would like to
 see what direction they are heading in as technology advances. The problem 
 of social isolation has become much more prevalent since the start of the 
 pandemic over a year ago and many people were affected by it, with the elderly 
 being one of the worst hit. Robotic companions allow for assistance of both mental
 and physical aspects of everyday life for elderly people, and they are able to act 
 as a sort of 24/7 caregiver due to their abilities to provide companionship and 
 genuine interactions with humans. We felt this type of technology could help 
 enhance the elderlyâ€™s well being and improve their mental state, which has been 
 proven to be a serious issue when regarding elderly people who are in isolation. 
 As time goes on, there is a possibility that the demand for robotic companions 
 could increase as it could very well expand to catering to more people than just 
 the elderly.
