<h1>Robotic Companions</h1>
<h2>Choices</h2>
<p class="whitebox">
While there are many directions in which this type of technology could go, 
taking in the fact that they are primarily focused on elderly people at this point 
in time should be focused on. There are certain implementations and design alterations 
which may need to happen to the robotic companion in order to fully cater to this particular 
age group. Based on a variety of studies, it was shown that many elderly people are still opposed 
to the idea of technology, let alone having said technology as a big part of their lives. Should 
further developments take place, it would be of best interest to include a variety of new features, 
which will help with the robotâ€™s compatibility and likability among not just the elderly but people 
of all age groups as well.
