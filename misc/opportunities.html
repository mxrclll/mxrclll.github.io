<h1>Robotic Companions</h1>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p class="intro">Significant events such as the pandemic have drastically changed
people’s lives, with many families being unable to interact with one-another
 in person. This has particularly affected elderly people as they are unlikely 
 to be living with family members, and due to the higher threat of mortality to 
 the elderly, they’re more susceptible to become socially isolated, as they are 
 likely to have fewer people around. As a result of social isolation, elderly people
 are more prone to suffering the psychological and physical effects of stress, 
 anxiety, and loneliness. To ease these feelings, social robots have been designed 
 to improve a person’s wellbeing by providing emotional support, cognitive assistance, 
 the fulfilling of basic social needs and companionship. Social robots are also used 
 therapeutically for the elderly who suffer from dementia and to support those with 
 complex medical issues including mental health. In addition to this, care-bots have 
 been developed to provide targeted assistance to people suffering from mental and 
 physical disabilities and are used to aid in the health care sector by using sensory 
 technology to monitor the patients’ health.
