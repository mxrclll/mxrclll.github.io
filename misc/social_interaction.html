<h1>Risks</h1>
<h2>Social Interaction</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
<p>First of all, when we make robots to complete people's work at a cheaper cost, 
the contact between people has been greatly reduced. Robots take on more and more 
workloads and caregiving responsibilities, which may greatly reduce the elderly Level 
of interpersonal communication. Robots can work 24 hours a day to take care of the elderly,
 and it may be convenient to feed the vulnerable elderly with an automatic spoon, but this 
 will eliminate the opportunity for meticulous and careful interpersonal communication between
 people. When we let robots take care of parents and grandparents, we may feel that we do not need 
 to visit them so many times because they have found the company they need. In fact, this would be a 
 mistake. For many elderly people, old age Human-robot interaction is less emotionally satisfying than 
 human interaction, because it feels that what the robot expresses or does is not "real", nor is it based 
 on realistic thoughts and feelings.
